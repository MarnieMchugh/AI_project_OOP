A machine learning program that calculates the likelyhood that you are an entrepenure based on the variables 
male or female 
did your parents own a business 
do you have a part time job
do you live in an urban or rural setting
did you take business studies corses 

I have used the Naive Bayes theorm for this, this may prove to have innacurate results as the above values aren't truly independent but seeing as it is my first machine learning project it will have to do
